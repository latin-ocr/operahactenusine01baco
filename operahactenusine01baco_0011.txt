to the hypothesis, for Bacon’s term for the four main divisions is volumen
(extract 23). We should then complete volume iv of the Magnum Opus
by a passage making the change into Moral Philosophy in the way indi-
cated in the early chapters of Part VII of the Opus Majus.

Bacon’s inveterate habit of using his material two or three times over is
illustrated in this work. I add a list of these coincidences. The reference
is only to passages on the pages cited, sometimes not of great length : pp.
1, 2, 3 coincide with Op. Tmtpp. 9, 1 1,12 and Introduction published by Dr.
Gasquet (pp. 498, 499) ; p. 3 with Op. Maj. ii. 255 ; p. 8 with ii. 229 sqq. ;
p. 9 with Op· Tert. p. 49 and Op. Maj. ii. 233 ; pp. 12, 13 with ii. 235-63 pp.
16,17 with ii. 241—2; pp. 18, 19, 20 with ii. 258, 259, 260-33 p. 23 with ii.
2513 pp. 24—8 with ii. 246-523 pp. 29—35 with ii. 267—75; p. 42 with iii.
743 pp. 42—52 with i. 254—67. A study of the changes made is interesting.

The manuscript from which this fragment is taken is in the Bibliotheque
Nationale‚ f. lat. 7440. The page measures 257 by 184 mm„ of which the
writing occupies 193 by 125 mm. Itis written in double columns of 51
lines each. The title is in a later hand 3 the running title is Metlzfz Roga
It follows the ‘Afforisimi Iohannis, de astrorum judiciis,' without any break
in the column. The tract has been separated in the binding, running from
folio 38b to 40b, and continued at folio 25a to 32b. Ι have endeavoured
to reproduce the spelling of the manuscript, with the exception of the
letters j and ν, for which the scribes had no distinctive form. The distinction
between t and cis not made, and I have leaned towards the use of c.
I¹ had at first written out the tract in the conventional form, but Ι do not
think the spelling of mediaeval scribes will cause more than a few minutes'
inconvenience to readers. In a few cases the grammar of the scribe
has failed him—they have not been altered.

If the present publication pays for paper and printing, Ι propose to follow
it up by the Communia Naturalium from the Mazarin MS. 3576 collated
with the British Museum MS. 7. F. vij as far as it goes, and with Digby
70 and 76, and by the fragments of the Communia Mathematz'ca. Ι have
copied the Ambrosian MS. R. 47. sup (which formerly belonged to Pinelli)
of the De Musica attributed to Bacon, but 1 do not believe it to be his.
The printing of the other two works would give us much information as to
the points in discussion at his time, and fill many blanks in our knowledge.

I have to acknowledge with thanks aid from Mr. Halliday Sparling (in
photographing the manuscript), Mr. Hehner, and Mr. Bickley. A photo-
graph of the MS. has been deposited in the Manuscript Department of the
British Museum.
