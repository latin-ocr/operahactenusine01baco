the book were Aristotle’s Aletaplzysics with the Commentary of Averroes
in a translation which omitted part of our first, and our tenth, thirteenth,
and fourteenth books, and Avicenna’s Prima Philosophia or Metaplzysz‘cs
in ten tracts or books. A discussion of his indebtedness to Aristotle must
be postponed to the introduction of the Communia Naturalium, and cannot
be complete till the publication of the Amiens MS. Avicenna’s influence
was more immediate, both on Bacon and on Albertus. He begins with
a study of the general definitions of physics, and -passes through a con-
sideration of unity and number to the first principle, to the study of pure
truth, and of moral philosophy, insomuch that Bacon often quotes it as
the Radices Moralz‘s Philosophia. Gundisalvi’s ‘ De divisione philosophiae,’
recently published, is largely founded on it. Bacon’s own conception of
the scope of Metaphysics is preserved for us in the Opus Majus in two
places—Part II.cap. 18 (vol. iii. p. 75) and PartVII.cap. 1 (vol. ii. pp. 226-9).

In an Appendix I have collected a number of extracts from Bacon’s
works, mainly from the M‘agnum Opus, ,indicating the scope of the
Metaphysz'cs. From extract 11 we learn that the beginning of ‚our frag-
ment is the first part of the M'etaphysics—aster (we may suppose) an
introductory passage of some length corresponding to those in vols. i, ii,
and iii. After this we find the ‘auctoritates sanctorum de laudibus
harum scienciarum' of extract 15, the reference to the immortality of the
soul (extract 2) and the comparison between Christian and infidel philo-
sophers (extracts 4, 14, 15). No reference is made to the proof of Chris·
tianity by astrology, which is incorporated in the Opus AInjus, and when
our fragment ends the greater part of the scheme has not been entered
on. We may suppose that Bacon proceeds to develop his definition of
Metaphysics as a general science of the foundation of all others on the
lines hinted at in extracts 1, 3, 5, 7, 12, 16, 17, 24, 25, δια, and then
deals with the order and divisions of each science (extracts 10, 25, 26).
An illustration of his division of rhetoric is given (extract 21), and by
extract 22 we find that some such passages as Op. Tert. p. 103 or Op.
Maj. vol. i. p. 99 were included here, as is almost shown by extract 13
referring to the latter passage. We may place here too the passage
alluded to in extract 18 treating of the meaning of certain logical terms.
Here too would come in its order the note on the possible number of
vowels (extract 9). The notes on mathematics would follow, many of
which are imbedded in Part IV of the Opus Majus, such as extracts 17
(vol. i. p. 152, δια), 8 (vol. i. p. 239), 19 (vol. i. p. 165), διε.

The remaining extracts 20, 27—33, raise an interesting question. They
plainly refer to some such treatise as the De Multzplicatione Specierum3
in fact 27 is plainly vol. ii. pp. 409-10, 31 is p. 493, and 32 p. 513. The
treatise itself is plainly part of the zllagnum Opus, as is shown by the
expressions on vol. ii. pp. 4c8 and 424, and Ι incline to place it towards
the end of the Affetaphysics. But two references to the quarta parte on
pp. 430 and 535 stand in the way. They are not necessarily contradictory
