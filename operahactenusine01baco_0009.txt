PREFACE

THE treatises of Roget Bacon on the subject of Metaphysics of which
we have any knowledge are the following :—

1. Questiones super primurn [etc.] Methaphisice, a magistro R. Baco.
(MS. Arniens 406, f. 74 sqq. described by Cousin, Journal des Savants, 1848,
pp· 459-72·)

2. Methaphisica fratris Rogeri ordinis Fratrum Minorum, de viciis
contractis in studio theologie. (MS. Digby 190, fol. 86 b, fragment3 Bibl.
Nat. 7440, ff. 38—40, 2 5—32‚ unfinished. Here printed.)

The names of others occur in old library lists. Three are found in the
library of St. Augustine’s, Canterbury, whose catalogue has been published
by Dr. James. They were in the possession of John of London.

3. ‘ Tractatus naturalis philosophie communis Rogeri Bacun et in eodem
libro. Tractatus de nutrimento et nutribili secundum eundem Rogerum
bacun. Tractatus de intellectu et intelligibili. Tractatus de sompno et
vigilia, et Methaphisice eiusdem Rogeri. (2 fo. et quod habet.) ’ 843.

4. ‘ Methaphisice R. Bacon in commento Averois super liber Ethicorum.'
843.

5. ‘Comentum Averois super librum Ethicorum: et in eodem libro
concordancie Ethicorum : poetria Aristotelis cum comento Averoys:

Averoys de substantia orbis: Avicenna de animalibus: Methaphisica ’

Rogeri Bacon: et Yconomica Aristotelis. (2 fo. quemadmodum.)' 1071.

Of the contents of these treatises (except the first) it is not easy to speak
with any approach to certitude. No. 1 seems from Cousin's account to
be a scholastic treatise on questions arising from the Metaplzysics of
Aristotle, with the exception of the third and fourth books. No. 2,
of which the surviving fragment is now printed for the first time, is
incomplete and gives no indication of its original length and scope.
But some ground of conjecture as to these exists. A number of references
to Methaphisica mea occur in undoubted works of Bacon. A comparison
of these will be our best guide to the contents of the lost book. The
Magnum opus (if Ι may provisionally name it so) on which Bacon had
been engaged for years when the papal command reached him was planned
to extend over four volumes (see extract 23): (1) Grammatica Logica,
(2) Communia Mathematica, (3) Communia Naturalium, (4) Methaphisica
etMoralia. Considerable portions of each of these were already written,
and some of them were utilized in the Opus Majus or in the Opus
Tertium, written to accompany it. Others were written later, as for
example parts of the Communia Naturalium. All however refer to the

*Metapltysics as already completed and well known.
