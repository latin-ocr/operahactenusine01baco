Philosophers also speak of true plasme, as Avicenna, Aristode, Cicero, Tully,
and others. (p. 15) A discussion follows leading up to the hope of (p. 16)
future happiness. The proof of this from philosophers can only be general, but
’Β quite plain, as is seen by long quotations from Avicenna. The mind is bound
by the body and mnnot attain perfect knowledge of it. (p. 18) Philosophers have
also spoken at length of morals. Read Aristotle and Tully, Senem, and Apuleius.
(p. 19) All philosophers wish us to be attracted by the bauty of virtue. (p. 20)
Sin impairs the vision of the soul‚ which like a rusted mirror returns a distorted
image to the beholder. Sin is a degrading thing, and makes man as low as the
beasts. (p. 21) Roed these authors named. They speak not only of morals and
religion, but of laws and statem-asts ; as Aristotle promises in the Ethics. (pp. 22-5)
Cities and states are of various kinds, according to their chief aims. Some look
only to glory or riches or pleasnre, some have many aims. Bacon follows
Avicenna in this passage at some length. The chief aim of a state should be the
worship of God, and the teaching of the truths of religion. After this (p. 26) the
legislator should make laws for the family and common life, (p. 27) commerce,
and study‚ and the removal of evildoers, (p. 28) and the discovery of the best
among contending sectS. Lastly he should provide for the choice of his successor.
(p. ²9) Bacon indicates the authors to be read on these matters. As to moral
virtues philosophers teach the contempt of this world’s good as the best
foundation for thern. He quotes Aristode, Theophrastus, (p. 30) Cicero,
Censorinus, Seneca. (p. 31) Apuleius, (p. 3²) Tully, Sallust, and others. (p. 33) He
then gives quotations from Tully, Cicero, Pliny, Secreta Secretorum, dealing with
gross ploesnroe, (p. 34) lust, (p. 35) eating and drinking, (p. 36) dress and luxury.

It appears, then, that the aim of philosophy is to inculmte the knowledge os
God and His angels, morals, and good laws with contempt for the things of this
life in view of future bliss. (p. 37) YVe require this tmching, for by nature we are
blind to such objects‚ and require inspiration to set us in search of them. (p. 38)
We do not even think human approach to perfectiori possible till a revelation is
made, and this revelation, philosophers are agreed, will be made by some prophet.
Avioenna describes his properties, and they agree with those of the Lord Jaeus
Christ. Bacon will limit himself to a few. (p. 39) By (1) the concurrence of the
prophecies of Ethicus, Alchimus, Plato, Albumazar; (2) by the nobility of our
sect which excels a11 others; (3) by the number of revelations vouchsafed to it;
(4) hythe noble conditions of our Lord who excels any other legislator (a) in
sanetity, (b) in perfect wisdom, (p. 41) judging meh sect by its own books; (5)
by the miracles of the legislator, as Alpharabius lays down; (6) by the testimony
of prophets coming before Him‚ as the Sybils, and the corpse found in the East
in the time of Irene and Constantine3 (p. 4²) (7) by a direct voice from heaven
attesting the legislator’s claims, as Avicenna says; and (8) by Astronorny which
investigat& the future of the various sects. Here Bacon ente-rs into an account of
the elements of Judiciary Astrology. He discusses the influences of the planets.
Jove and Venus are kindly, saturn and Mars malevolent. Mer-cury is good with
good, bad with bad. (p. 43) The heavens are divided into twelve houses‚ each with
their properties and ruling planets. He then describes the conjunctions of the
planets with their influence on sects. (p. 44) Satur-n the planet of the Jews comes
first, and all Gentile knowledge oerne after Moses and the law, as Bacon shows at
length. (p. 45) When Jove is in conjunction with Mars comes the law of the
Chaldeans, with the Sun, the law of Egypt, with Venus, the law of the SaracenS,
as may be seen from Ovid De Vetula. With Mercury the Christian religion is
